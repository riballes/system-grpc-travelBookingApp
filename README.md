# system-grpc-travelBookingApp

## INTRO
gRPC is an open source remote procedure call (RPC) system initially developed at Google. It uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and provides features such as authentication, bidirectional streaming and flow control, blocking or nonblocking bindings, and cancellation and timeouts. It generates cross-platform client and server bindings for many languages.

## IMPLEMENTATION
With the usage of GRPC, create a local distributed Application supporting Travel Scheduling and Booking of Airplane, Car and Hotel.

In my case, the language of preference was Python, implementing the remote procedure in a local machine.
